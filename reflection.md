# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
I made some adjustments to my already existing code, though none of it works because I got heavily lost a while back,
and I haven't been able to fix anything for the time being.
## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
A lot of what is taught in class is very difficult to utilize in the labs and milestone projects, despite being easy conceptually.
## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
That computer science is awfully difficult for anyone that is a slow learner.
